title: Hello World
date: 02/04/2011

On the last couple of hours I've been setting up this new blog you are
looking at. I have decided to go with [toto], a rack-based blog that is
painfully simple to use and run.

What makes it great is: If I want to post something new all I have to do is create a new txt file and push to Heroku. I instantly fell in love with it mainly because of this.

Design is not finished yet, and is pretty much a ripoff from a toto-powered [blog] which inspired me. <del>Nor there is a comment system.</del> I'm using Twitter for comments. \o/

More coming soon. See ya!
