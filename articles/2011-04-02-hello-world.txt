On the last couple of hours I've been setting up this new blog you are
looking at. I have decided to go with [toto], a rack-based blog that is
painfully simple to use and run.

What makes it great is: If I want to post something new all I have to do is create a new txt file and push to Heroku. I instantly fell in love with it mainly because of this.

Design is not finished yet, and is pretty much a ripoff from a
toto-powered [blog] which inspired me. <del>Nor there is a comment
system. I'm using Twitter for comments. \o/</del> Topsy sucks for
retrieving real data, so now I just have a twitter link. Enough for me.

More coming soon. See ya!
