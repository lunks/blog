On the last couple of hours I've been setting up this new blog you are looking at. I have decided to go with [toto], a rack-based blog that is painfully simple to use and run. Design is not finished yet, and is pretty much a ripoff from a toto-powered [blog] which inspired me. Nor there is a comment system.

But... if I want to post something new all I have to do is create a new txt file and push to Heroku. That's amazing! I instantly fell in love with it mainly because of this.

More coming soon. See ya!
