title: Setting up a DHCP/NAT server with dnsmasq
date: 20/05/2010

dnsmaq, a program by Simon Kelley, is a DNS and DHCP server, very
useful, and quite simple. From it's website:

> Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP
> server. It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a
> small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are
> not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS
> server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear
> in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in a
> central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic
> DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP/PXE for network booting of diskless
> machines.

## The backstory

Normally I don't ever need to worry about DNS servers at all. My
parents have a Linksys router in the basement which connects to
Verizon's DSL network. The router comes with a DHCP server
pre-configured, and is easily further configurable via a web
interface. My computer connects through a series of hubs until it
gets to the basement. Nothing all that complex. Computer (A)
connects to the home network, a patch work series of cables
throughout the house until it finally reaches router (B). Simple.

Except, my parents and I got into a little spat. Teenager angst vs
parental "we know what's good for you", of course I don't believe
what they said at the time is the best thing for me. Anyways, this
argument resulted my computer being physically disconnected from
the LAN! It was meant to serve as punishment, but I ended up
getting around that pretty easily.

Here's how, for all you miscreants out there.

## The setup

You're going to need a device, of any kind, with at least 2
connections. The principles used here are also what makes
[tethering][] work: In one port, out the other. In tethering, the
'in' port is the cellphone's USB connection, connected to the
computer. The 'out' port is Verizon's / AT&T's 3G network.

In my case, I had a blackberry, and blackberry & Linux tethering is
an *even more* annoying thing to set up than someone learning DHCP
for the first time, so I choose to use the infrastructure I already
had in my room: my laptop and my personal network hub.

For nearly every room, there is a network hub with 4 or 8 ports
(depending on the model). The need arose when [my brother][] and I
had multiple computers in our rooms at the same time. I once had 3
computers at the same time! So instead of running lots of cables
between the rooms, we (and I do me we, I set up my segment of the
network myself) set up a hub in each room so only one cable needed
to be ran from room to room instead of multiple ones.

For my setup, I used my **laptop** and my **hub**. I would, in a
sense anyways, *tether my desktop computer to my laptop.* This is a
rudimentary explanation, but if you don't understand what I'm about
to say, then I hope you at least understand that phrase.

My laptop runs Linux. [Arch Linux][] to be exact. For you Windows
users out there, sorry, this post ends here.

dnsmasq's default configuration file is *huge* with 540 lines. Most
of it is comments explaining the various options, but for just a
basic DHCP server, you only need 3 options, in
`/etc/dnsmasq.conf`:

bind-interfaces 
:   Have dnsmasq connect to all interfaces. (127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0)
interface=eth0 
:   The network interface you want dnsmasq to listen for DHCP
    requests. This is the so-called 'in' port. (My parlance, meant to
    simplify it for you. Not the real term, but I can care less in this
    post.)
dhcp-range=10.18.1.100,10.18.1.200,24h 
:   Read the comments for the correct syntax, there's no need to
    repeat it here. This is the range of IP addresses you want dnsmasq
    to lease (or 'hand-out').

After you've configured it, dnsmasq is done! Now you need to set up
your network interfaces. Have eth0 (or whatever you used in the
interface= line in dnsmasq.conf) be set to a static IP, and your
external-facing interface (wlan0 on my laptop) configured properly
as well. This second interface is the 'out' port.

You're not done yet! You still need to configure the kernel to
allow IP forwarding. This doesn't involve any kernel compiling at
all, just a few commands and [iptables][].

    # Thanks to anxrc from #archlinux on Freenode for the commands!
    iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Make sure to change wlan0 and eth0 to the correct 'out' and 'in'.
After running these commands, you can start dnsmasq (Arch folks:
`/etc/rc.d/dnsmasq start`).

And that's it! If your other computer (in my case, my desktop) was
already configured to use DHCP, you don't need to do any other
configuration. Everything is handled by dnsmasq. If you have a
static IP, make sure it's at least in the same subnet as dnsmasq's
configuration.

dnsmasq has a *lot* more configurable options. For more information
about what it can do (such as integrating a DNS server with the
DHCP records) check out its [homepage][] and Arch's
[wiki page on dnsmasq][]. Google it as well, there are a lot of
articles about dnsmasq!
