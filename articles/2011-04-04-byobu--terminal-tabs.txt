title: Byobu > Terminal tabs

tag: linux

For the last three days I've been using [Byobu]. It's basically screen
but with a nice menu for settings things up, easier management controls
and sort of 'tray'. It also handles tabs (as it uses screen).
~
To use it, first install if not installed. On Ubuntu:
    :::term
    $ sudo apt-get install byobu
Then just run *byobu*. Hit \<F2\> for creating a new screen, \<F3\> to
go to the previous and \<F4\> to go to the next one. \<F9\> will summon
its configuration menu, which will allow you to set byobu to run when
you start a new login shell (useful for remote servers), *tray* plugins
and more.

Note: on my machine \<F9\> was already being handled by Compiz, but you can cheat and user
Super+\<F9\>, and the menu will come up. You may set a different
shortcut if you want.
