If you want to post on Google+ and want that post to appear on Facebook
as well, it's simple: hop to [Facebook Mobile][fbm] and look for the
'Upload by Email' section. Copy that email, add it as either one of your
friends or to a special 'Facebook' circle like I did, and voila:
Whenever you post to Google+ and post to the circle Facebook Mobile is
in, your post will be shared across Facebook.
